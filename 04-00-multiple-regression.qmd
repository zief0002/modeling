# Multiple Regression

In this unit you will learn about using multiple regression model to describe and infer about the relationship between a quantitative outcome and multiple predictor variables. You will also learn about statistical control and how we can use statistical control to make stronger claims about predictor effects. Finally you will learn how to evaluate the distributional assumptions that underlie the multiple regression model.
