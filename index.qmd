The content in this "book", as the title suggests, is related to statistical modeling and computation. More specifically, the content focuses on using the General Linear Model (GLM) to provide statistical evidence that can help answer substantive questions in the educational and social sciences. It is a book intended for applied practitioners in the educational or social sciences. The statistical content is hopefully presented in a manner that these domain scientists will find useful, including practical suggestions for analysis and the presentation of results intended to help researchers clearly communicate the results of a data analysis.

While the content is not overly mathematical in nature, the reader will need a solid understanding of the principles in algebra for maximum benefit. The burden of calculation that typically accompanied statistical work in previous generations is now primarily carried out in a scientific computing environment. As @thisted2 point out, "computational advances have changed the face of statistical practice by transforming what we do and by challenging how we think about scientific problems." To support and help facilitate the use of scientific computing, examples using the R computer language will be used throughout this work. 

The organization of content is consistent with the sequence this content is taught in EPsy 8251, the first of two applied statistics courses that form the foundational sequence for many graduate students in the educational and social sciences at the University of Minnesota. This course require that students have taken a previous statistics course at either the undergraduate or graduate level. Because of that, many introductory ideas are assumed.
