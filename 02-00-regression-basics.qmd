# Regression Basics

In this unit we will introduce the ideas of regression. You will learn about using the simple regression model to describe the relationship between two quantitative variables. You will also learn how the parameters for this model are estimated and how correlation and regression are related. Finally you will learn how to carry out statistical inference on the regression parameters.
